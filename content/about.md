**Hi! I'm Christian ðŸ‘‹,**  

Lead Software Engineer in the Stuttgart area, specializing in firmware development and software architecture for embedded systems.  

I'm a true tinkerer â€“ I love taking technology apart, understanding how it works, and putting it back together. I'm particularly fascinated by small projects like this website, into which I pour a lot of passion.  

For many years, I've been working in embedded software development, gaining extensive experience in firmware design, software architectures, and build systems. My focus is not just on writing efficient code but also on creating clean, well-structured solutions that remain maintainable and scalable in the long run.  

On this page, I share my thoughts and experiences â€“ from technology and software design to leadership and personal development.
